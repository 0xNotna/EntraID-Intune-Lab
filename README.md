# Splunk-AD-Lab

### Note: Work in progress — I haven’t uploaded everything yet.


## Objective 

This project is helping me learn real-world enterprise tasks by working with Active Directory and using Splunk to understand how to identify, analyse, and respond to cyberattacks to Harden Security.

### Skills Learned

- Configured Active Directory Domain Controller on Windows Server 2022
- Deployed and managed Splunk on Ubuntu for log analysis
- Set up and secured Windows 10 AD-joined clients
- Configured Kali Linux attack VM for testing
- Assigned static IPs and managed network routing with NAT Network
- Designed and documented network topology
- Applied security hardening and Group Policy settings
- Managed VM snapshots for backup and recovery

### Tools Used

- Windows Server 2022 (AD Domain Controller)  
- Ubuntu (Splunk Server)  
- Windows 10 (AD Client)  
- Kali Linux (Attack VM)  
- VirtualBox/VMware (Virtual Machines)  
- Splunk  
- Group Policy Management  

## Steps

## *1. Network Diagram*
Created a clear and detailed network topology diagram to visually represent the layout and relations between all devices, IP configurations, helping to plan and troubleshoot
